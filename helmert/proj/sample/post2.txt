I've found the answer to this.  The rotation is meant to be in seconds not
degrees.  I used degrees because of this post on google groups. It seems that
Martin made a typo. I see now it's obvious from the numbers.

Here's the corrected test.  The parameters are the same as those in the proj
string except for the sign of the rotation.

las2las64 -i g.txt -iparse xyz \
    -transform_affine 0.99960269575,5.6078691E-01,-20.3070168478,-17.3858693056 \
    -rescale 0.001 0.001 0.001 -stdout -otxt

Perhaps las2las -h could be a little more detailed?
